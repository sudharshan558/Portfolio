## Inspiration

This portfolio is themed after **Vagabond** — the legendary manga by Inoue Takehiko, based on the life of Miyamoto Musashi. The raw ink-on-paper aesthetic, the crosshatch textures, the scattered ink drops, the void black and aged parchment — every visual decision was intentional.

Like Musashi sharpening his blade daily, this portfolio represents the same commitment to craft in software.
